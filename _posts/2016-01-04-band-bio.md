This Day Burns is a band with a unique approach to song writing and performance. They have found a way to unconventionally express music from many perspectives. Each member switches and plays an array of instruments through out the writing and performing process, giving them the ability to collaborate music on a different level. Their sound can only be described as diverse, unpredictable and energetic.
